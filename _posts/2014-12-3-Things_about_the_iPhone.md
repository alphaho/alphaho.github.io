title: Things about the iPhone/iOS
---

I have been using iPhone for a year after using my Andriod phone.  
Here's some feelings about it.

### Bad: it can't show the phone number in Phone
If one of your contacts have multiple phone number, you can't see his/her number in Phone.  What's worse, if you mistakenly set more than one number "mobile", you can't learn which one you have dialed and what else you should try next.

### Bad: there's a tab limit in Safari
Unlike Chrome which has unlimited tabs, Safari in iPhone does has a upper limit for tabs. I have a "bad habbit" keeping quite some tabs openning. So this makes me quite nervous when I have a lot of tabs in Safari. I would worry whether some of my previous tabs will get killed when I open a new one, especially through a third-party app.  
However, sometimes Chrome may crash and lost all my tabs! So it may not be that bad that Safari keeps reminding me to kill some tabs.

### Bad: Popup windows.
The popup windows are quite annoying when you get farmiliar with the phone. 

For example, every time the battery drops to 20% and 10%, it pops up a window telling you this. As the battery is not very reliable, such popup will come up a few times a day. Makes it quite annoying. Especially when you are watching videos/movies, or reading through a passage. It drags your attention directly out from what you are doing and you can't ignore it! This interuption makes you angry sometimes when you are trying to figure out how it goes in the movie or how the story goes in a passage.   
I think it would be better maybe through a red drop-down notification or blink in red a few seconds like you get hit in the shotting game. This would be much nicer than popping up a screen telling you a crucial fact that your battery is low. But what you always do is ignore it and come back to what you do immediately. And when it comes to an "check point", you will then try to plug your phone to the power source.

Another popup I usally see is that tells you to turn on the Wi-Fi to get the more accurate location. This always get ignored by me as I turn my Wi-Fi off by intention. But the interuption in my workflow makes me sad every time.

### Good: the Do Not Disturb mode
By turning this mode on, all the async messages and notifications would not light up the screen and make vibration. But still can make the phone calls come in. So I think this is excellent for turnning on at work or watching movie. As you won't get distracted by any messages/notifications (which are not very urgent), but if any phone call comes in, it will ring your phone so you won't miss it.

I think this is much better than turning your cell into completely silent(no rings and vibration). As you may get worried and keep checking your phone every few minutes. So it helps to focus on the task.


### Good: the bird view in Safari
As I keep a lot of tabs, the bird view mode in Safari is great for me. Makes it earier to find my tab and learn how many tabs and what tabs I have.

### Good: excellent ecosystem
It gives me the feeling that everything I want it already has an app sitting there in the App Store. And the app quality is very good.  
Another thing is after upgrading to Yosemite/iOS 8, the interoperation between the Mac and iPhone/iPad makes life easier.

### Good: the backup function
I'm quite surprised the first time when I found out how good the backup fuction can do. It not only backups the apps and settings. But also the state of the app. For example, it can backup the tabs I've opened in Safari. When I restore from the backup, the tabs order and which tab I was on is all the same!  
This is awesome to me!
